                        <p>Hello, my name is Jared Selling.  I am 21, and currently reside in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  I attend college at Florida Atlantic University where I am working towards a degree in Computer Science.  The languages I know at this time are C and C++, but I am always striving to cover more outside of classes and add to my repository of programming skills.  In my free time, I am currently learning Java and PHP.</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>Ultimately, I aspire to become a video game designer and developer.  To that end, I devote large amounts of my time outside of classes to working in the Unreal Engine, learning how to implement game logic and integrating various outside resources to design levels and worlds.  It's a vast topic, and I'm only just beginning to scratch the surface of all that the Unreal Engine is capable of, but I'm loving every second!</p>
                        
                        <br>
                        
                        <p>This webpage will ultimately serve as a portfolio where all of my school-related and independant projects will be stored for easy access.  I will likely include various programming assignments from university and games that I am working on outside of college.  As of now, I have included links to my social media so that potential employeers or academic peers can keep track of my progress and so that I can easily communicate with them.</p>
